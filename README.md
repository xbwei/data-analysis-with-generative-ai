# Data Analysis with Generative AI

This public repository contains advanced notebooks and tutorials that explore the use of **generative AI tools**—such as OpenAI’s GPT models—for social data analysis, prompt engineering, and automated workflows.

It complements the textbook [_Social Data Analytics in the Cloud with AI_](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003437611/social-data-analytics-cloud-ai-xuebin-wei-xinyue-ye) (Wei & Ye, 2024), and previews cutting-edge methods under development for the upcoming **second edition**.

## 🌟 Highlights

- 🔍 **Prompt Engineering & Twitter Data**  
  Analyze, summarize, and visualize Twitter data using custom prompts and OpenAI tools.

- 🤖 **LLM Function Calling**  
  Automatically grade MongoDB queries using OpenAI Function Calling and assistant workflows.

- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  Explore vector databases and agent-based reasoning to analyze and interact with tweet content.

- 🎨 **Vision-Language Models**  
  Classify, recreate, and edit tweet images using OpenAI Vision models and diffusion techniques.
