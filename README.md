# Data Analysis with Generative AI

This public repository contains advanced notebooks and tutorials that explore how generative AI tools—such as OpenAI’s GPT models—can be applied for social data analysis, prompt engineering, and automated workflows.

It complements the textbook **Social Data Analytics in the Cloud with AI** (Wei & Ye, 2024) and previews cutting-edge methods under development for the upcoming second edition.
